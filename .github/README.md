# Subjective's dotfiles

These are the dotfiles I use on my Mac system, currently running [MacOS Ventura][ventura]. My editor of choice is [Neovim][neovim], but I also use [VSCode][vscode] occasionally. The instructions are adapted from Joshua Steele's [dotfiles repository][joshua-steele].

## Prerequisites

The dotfiles assume you are running macOS with the following software pre-installed:

- [Git][git]
- [Homebrew][homebrew] (including [coreutils][coreutils])
- [Ruby][ruby]
- [Node.js][nodejs]
- [Zsh][zsh] or [Fish][fish]
- [Oh-My-Zsh][oh-my-zsh] (if using zsh)
- [Neovim][neovim]
- [Tmux][tmux]

## Installation

I'm using a bare git repo with its working tree set to my home directory to manage my dotfiles without symlinks.

1. Setup your shell. (See Fish/Zsh instructions below.)

2. Run the following commands in the shell to clone the dotfiles:

```
$ git clone --bare <remote-git-repo-url> $HOME/.cfg
$ alias dotfiles='/usr/bin/git --git-dir=$HOME/.cfg/ --work-tree=$HOME'
$ dotfiles config --local status.showUntrackedFiles no
$ dotfiles checkout
```

## Zsh Setup

I recently switched from [Oh My Zsh][oh-my-zsh] to [Zim][zim] as my primary Zsh configuration framework/plugin manager. Not only is it much faster, but it also handles automatic installation and updating of custom plugins. If you want to learn more, check out this [post](https://www.joshyin.cc/blog/speeding-up-zsh).

1. Install zsh: `$ brew install zsh`
1. Install custom plugins: `$ zimfw install`

## Fish Setup

1. Install fish: `$ brew install fish`
1. Install [fisher][fisher]:
   `$ curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jorgebucaran/fisher/main/functions/fisher.fish | source && fisher install jorgebucaran/fisher`
1. Restart your computer.
1. Install [tide][tide] theme:
   `$ fisher install IlanCosman/tide@v5`

## Post-install Tasks

After cloning the dotfiles repo there are still a couple of things that need to be done.

- Set up iTerm2 or Kitty profile (see details below).
- Complete [Brew Bundle][brew-bundle] and install packages with `$ brew bundle install`
- Install [Rust][rust] via Rustup: `$ curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh`
- Install neovim via [bob][bob]: `$ cargo install bob-nvim`
- After opening Neovim, run [`:checkhealth`][checkhealth] and resolve errors/warnings.
- If using Fish, customize your setup by running the `$ fish_config` command.

## Setting up iTerm2

1. Open iTerm2.
1. Select iTerm2 > Preferences.
1. Under the General tab, check the box labeled "Load preferences from a custom folder or URL:"
1. Press "Browse" and point it to `~/.config/iterm2/com.googlecode.iterm2.plist`.
1. Restart iTerm2.

## Setting up Kitty

Getting set up after a fresh install is simple.

1. Tweak preferences in `~/.config/kitty/kitty.conf`
1. Uncomment Alacritty terminfo lines in `~/.tmux.conf`
1. Setup [alternative][alt-kitty-icon] MacOS application icon for Kitty.
1. Run Kitty!

## Setting up yabai and skhd

I use a tiling window manager called [yabai][yabai] to manage my windows and workspaces and the hotkey daemon [skhd][skhd] to customize yabai's keyboard shortcuts. However, in order to enable all of of yabai's features such as border highlights, instant switching between spaces, and window animations, [System Integrity Protection (SIP)][system-integrity-protection] must be partially disabled.

1. Partially Disable System Integrity Protection according the [yabai docs][disable-sip].
1. Configure Scripting Addition according to the [yabai docs][configure-scripting-addition]
1. Start yabai and skhd:

```
$ yabai --start-service
$ skhd --start-service
```

## Backing up app settings and personal files

### Mackup for backup

[Mackup](https://github.com/lra/mackup) is a fantastic tool that allows you to: backup personal application settings and private data; sync that data between computers; and then easily restore your configuration to a fresh install â€” all in a simple command line interface. Seems good!

While by no means a comprehensive backup solution, Mackup keeps things simple, currently supports [over 360 applications](https://github.com/lra/mackup/mackup/applications) and can store data on Dropbox, Google Drive, iCloud or any path you can copy to.

#### How I use Mackup

I store on iCloud and explicitly declare which apps to sync and which to ignore â€” anything handled by my dotfiles is ignored (bash, git, vim etc.)

I backup a wide range of other applications including those containing credentials such as aws, gnupg and ssh. It's also possible to backup apps not natively supported using custom `.cfg` files. For example, to backup [Ulysses](https://ulyssesapp.com) (an amazing markdown writing app), create a `~/.mackup` directory and place a `ulysses.cfg` file inside:

```ini
[application]
name = Ulysses

[configuration_files]
Library/Preferences/com.soulmen.ulysses3.plist
Library/Preferences/com.ulyssesapp.mac.plist
```

It is usually straight-forward to find which `.plist` files in `Library/Preferences` you'll need to list, they always feature the application name.

Taking that a step further we can also declare a "personal files" application using a `personal-files.cfg` and then cherry pick any other files we want to backup while keeping them out of a public repo:

```ini
[application]
name = Personal Files

[configuration_files]
.gitconfig.local
.extra
```

When I declare this in my main [`.mackup.cfg`](mackup/.mackup.cfg) they are handled with ease:

```ini
[storage]
engine = iCloud
directory = Mackup

# Apps to sync â€” if empty, syncs all supported.
# custom: personal-files, ulysses
[applications_to_sync]
personal-files
spotify
...
ulysses
```

A simple `$ mackup backup` saves everything to iCloud and I can later `$ mackup restore` on a fresh install to get these settings back (you can also easily `$ mackup uninstall`).

## Colorschemes

My all-time favorite colorscheme for code-editing is [Catppuccin][catppuccin]. That said, there are times when I like to dabble with something new, just to have some variety.

![One Half Dark Screenshot][catppuccin-screenshot]

_Example of a React app with the Catppuccin colorscheme_

Here's how everything is organized:

#### 1. Colorschemes

The settings for individual colorschemes are stored in . To add a new colorscheme, add a file for it here.

#### 2. Terminal Colorschemes

Since I use vim in the terminal, I need corresponding iTerm2 or Kitty colorschemes for every vim colorscheme. My iTerm2 colorschemes are stored in `itermcolors/`, but of course must be added manually to the iTerm profile. Kitty colorschemes are defined in `~/.config/kitty/themes/` and can be set with kitty's built-in theme manager: `$ kitty +kitten themes --reload-in=all`.

Multiple pre-made colorschemes are available online for both iTerm2 and Alacritty:

- [iTerm2 colorschemes][iterm2-colorschemes]
- [Kitty colorschemes][kitty-colorschemes]

#### 3. Tmux Custom Overrides

The last tweak is for Tmux. I like to set a custom statusline depending on what colorscheme I'm using. The main `tmux.conf` file contains all the settings that Tmux needs. Uncomment the section for a specific statusline to enable it.

```
## Detailed Catppuccin Statusline ##

# Set status bar color to match background
set-option -g status-style bg=default

## Set status bar position to top
# set-option -g status-position top

## Change spacing between window and statusline
if -F '#{!=:#{status},2}' {
  set -Fg 'status-format[1]' '#{status-format[0]}'
  set -g 'status-format[0]' ''
  set -g status 2
}

[...]
```

I also use [tmux plugin manager](https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tpm) to manage my tmux plugins. Clone the repository and press `prefix` + `I` to install plugins:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tpm ~/.tmux/plugins/tpm
```

## My Favorite Programming Fonts

I've recently branched out to explore some of the different mono-spaced fonts available, both free and premium. Here is a list of my favorites.

### Free Fonts

_Included in my `Brewfile` and installed by default via [Homebrew Cask Fonts][homebrew-cask-fonts]_

- [Fira Code][fira-code]
- [Caskaydia Cove][caskaydia-cove]
- [Hack Mono][hack-mono]
- [JetBrains Mono][jetbrains-mono]

### Premium Fonts

_You have to give people money if you want these._ ðŸ¤‘

- [Operator Mono][operator-mono]
- [MonoLisa][monolisa]
- [Dank Mono][dank-mono]

### Ligatures

I first discovered ligatures through [Fira Code][fira-code], which IMO is probably the king of programming fonts. After using Fira Code, it's hard to go back to a sans-ligature typeface. Therefore â€ all the fonts I've included in my fave's list _do_ include ligatures, although some have more than others.

â€  _Operator Mono does not include ligatures but [can be easily patched][operator-mono-lig] to add them._

### Nerd Font Variants

I use [Devicons][devicons] in my editor, and these require patched fonts in order to display properly. For most free fonts, there are pre-patched [Nerd Font][nerd-fonts-downloads] variants that include the various glyphs and icons.

[Homebrew Cask Fonts][homebrew-cask-fonts] includes both original and Nerd Font variants. For example:

```sh
# Original font
$ brew cask install font-fira-code

# Patched variant
$ brew cask install font-firacode-nerd-font
```

If using a font that does not have a patched variant (e.g. MonoLisa) iTerm2 has an option to use an alternate font for non-ASCII characters.
